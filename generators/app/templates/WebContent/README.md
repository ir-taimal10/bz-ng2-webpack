### Quick start
**Make sure you have Node version >= 4.0 and NPM >= 3**
> Clone the repo

```bash
# clone our repo
# --depth 1 removes all but one .git commit history
git clone --depth 1 https://giturl

# change directory to our repo
cd {projectFolder}/WebContent

# Step 1: Add required global libraries
npm install typings webpack-dev-server rimraf webpack -g

# Step 2: Install the repo with npm
npm install

# Step 3: Start the server
npm start

# use Hot Module Replacement
npm run server:dev:hmr

```

## for development purposes
go to [http://0.0.0.0:3000](http://0.0.0.0:3000) or [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser


## Running the app
After you have installed all dependencies you can now run the app. Run `npm run server` to start a local server using `webpack-dev-server` which will watch, build (in-memory), and reload for you. The port will be displayed to you as `http://0.0.0.0:3000` (or if you prefer IPv6, if you're using `express` server, then it's `http://[::1]:3000/`).

### server

# development
npm run server
# production
npm run build:prod
npm run server:prod
```
